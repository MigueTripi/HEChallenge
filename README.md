# Projects

You will find two simple projects in .net folder:
- Console project which one you can add the arrays you would like to sum.
- There is a Business project where the logic is allocated.
- Test project which one have some data validations and some real cases

# Algorithms

I have decided to iterate always the first provided array and sum its values with the second array values. 
I didn't create any reversed array for the second array, I have accessed to its values calculating the indexes in reverse way. 


# SQL 
You can find in SQL folder a T-SQL script which contains:
- DB creation
- Tables creation (I assumed data times)
- Data initialization for testing proposes
- Query for asked data.
